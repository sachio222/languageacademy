      term: "Possessive Adjectives Overview",
      definition:
        "Words that show ownership and go directly before the noun they modify",
      example:
        "15 total forms: MY (mon/ma/mes), YOUR informal (ton/ta/tes), HIS/HER (son/sa/ses), OUR (notre/nos), YOUR formal (votre/vos), THEIR (leur/leurs)",

      term: "üîë CRITICAL RULE: Agreement with the THING owned",
      definition:
        "The possessive adjective matches the gender/number of the THING being owned, NOT the owner",
      example:
        "Marie's book = SON livre (masculine 'son' because 'livre' is masculine, even though Marie is female). Pierre's house = SA maison (feminine 'sa' because 'maison' is feminine, even though Pierre is male)",
    },
    {
      term: "Formal vs Informal 'Your'",
      definition:
        "French has two ways to say 'your' depending on relationship and respect level",
      example:
        "INFORMAL with friends/family: ton/ta/tes (ton fr√®re, ta s≈ìur, tes amis). FORMAL with strangers/respect: votre/vos (votre bureau, vos bagages)",
    },
    {
      term: "Gender-Neutral Forms",
      definition:
        "Some possessives don't change for masculine/feminine - only for singular/plural",
      example:
        "NOTRE/NOS (our): notre maison, notre jardin, nos enfants. VOTRE/VOS (your formal): votre livre, votre famille, vos id√©es. LEUR/LEURS (their): leur chat, leur maison, leurs amis",
    },
    {
      term: "Memory Trick: The 3-2-2 Pattern",
      definition: "Each owner has a predictable number of forms to memorize",
      example:
        "MY, YOUR (informal), HIS/HER = 3 forms each (masc/fem/plural). OUR, YOUR (formal), THEIR = 2 forms each (singular/plural only)",
